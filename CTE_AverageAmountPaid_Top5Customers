Finding the average amount paid by the top 5 customers: 

WITH top_5_cust_total_amount_pd (total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule', 'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY A.customer_id,
	B.first_name,
	B.last_name,
	D.city,
	E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
--end CTE details

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
FROM top_5_cust_total_amount_pd


Below is the SQL query used to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country: 

WITH top_customers (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS 
(SELECT 
    A.customer_id,
	B.first_name AS customer_first_name,
	B.last_name AS customer_last_name,
	D.city,
	E.country,
	SUM (A.amount) AS total_amount_paid 
	FROM payment A
    	INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    	INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
   		INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    	INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
   		WHERE D.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule','Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
    	GROUP BY A.customer_id,
			B.first_name,
			B.last_name,
			D.city,
			E.country
    	ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    	LIMIT 5) 
--end CTE details		

SELECT D.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_customers
    ON A.customer_id = top_customers.customer_id
    AND D.country = top_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY top_customer_count DESC;
